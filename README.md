# IPPS Reinforcement Learning Framework

This repository provides an implementation of a reinforcement learning approach for solving the Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling (IPPS) problem. The repository includes the dataset, environment, training code, and a script to find the optimal solution.

data/---Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
env/---Defines the reinforcement learning environment for the IPPS problem.
run/---Main script to train the reinforcement learning agent.
max/--Script to find the best scheduling solution based on trained models.
